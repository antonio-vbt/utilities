* **The Lost Art of Structure Packing** - http://www.catb.org/esr/structure-packing/ - An explanation on how *structs* in C (and C++ to an extent) are organized and laid out in memory. Provides explanations and examples on how many bytes these *structs* will consume, why some  may use more space than the sum of its underlying members and other related topics. A useful and interesting read in general and a must when using *struct casts* to reinterpret memory.

* **Bit Twiddling Hacks** - https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html - A list of various clever techniques to deal with bitwise operations, such as finding the first set bit in a value or how many bits are set in total. Useful when dealing with extreme memory/time constraints or just to show off. Do comment your code about what is going on as these can get pretty obscure :)
