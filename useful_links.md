* **The Lost Art of Structure Packing** - http://www.catb.org/esr/structure-packing/ - An explanation on how `struct`s in C (and C++ to an extent) are organized and laid out in memory. Provides explanations and examples on how many bytes these `struct`s will consume, why some  may use more space than the sum of its underlying members and other related topics. A useful and interesting read in general and a must when casting data to `struct`s to reinterpret memory.

* **Bit Twiddling Hacks** - https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html - A list of various clever techniques to deal with bitwise operations, such as finding the first set bit in a value or how many bits are set in total. Useful when dealing with extreme memory/time constraints..

* **The most thoroughly commented linker script** - https://blog.thea.codes/the-most-thoroughly-commented-linker-script/ - An in-depth look at a linker script, explaining the purpose of each snippet individually. A good introduction to what is going on in a simple linker script.
